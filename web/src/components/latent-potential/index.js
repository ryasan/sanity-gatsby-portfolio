            &quot;When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his
            rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the
            hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that
            did it&#8212;but all that had gone before.&quot;

          Often times it&apos;s easy feel stagnant when faced with a difficult task. Perhaps
          you&apos;ve decided to resign because the finish line doesn&apos;t appear to be anywhere
          in site. Maybe you&apos;ve been trying to learn how to do a kick flip on a skateboard for
          the past one thousand hours but still haven&apos;t landed a single one. Don&apos;t quit!
          Progress isn&apos;t how we think it&apos;s suppose to be. Check it out...

          <b>Fig. 1</b> - We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope that it
          will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not
          until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have
          done.

          The diagram above is called the &quot;Plateau of Latent Potential&quot; and it states that
          work is never wasted. It is simply being stored and that sometimes it won&apos;t be until
          much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

          Anyways this is something I remind myself constantly now and it always eventually proves
          to be true. With the correct mind set, we are capable of things we would never expect from
          ourselves ðŸ˜„
